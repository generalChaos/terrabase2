# üé≠ Fibbing It - Complete Game Flow Documentation

## üéØ **Game Overview**

**Fibbing It** is a deception game where players create believable lies to factual questions and try to spot the truth among the fiction.

### **üéÆ Core Concept**
- **Knowledge**: Players use trivia knowledge for correct answers
- **Deception**: Successfully fooling other players with believable bluffs
- **Detection**: Identifying the truth among the bluffs
- **Social**: Reading other players and their tells
