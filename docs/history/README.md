## 🔮 Next Phase Planning

### **Phase 5: Complete Test Coverage** (Next 2-3 days)
- **Objective**: Achieve 100% test pass rate
- **Focus**: Resolve remaining 6 failing test suites
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: Deep service interface analysis

### **Phase 6: Feature Enhancement** (Next 1 week)
- **Objective**: Complete game flow implementation
- **Focus**: Advanced game features and performance optimization
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: 100% test coverage

### **Phase 7: Production Readiness** (Next 1-2 weeks)
- **Objective**: Production deployment preparation
- **Focus**: Monitoring, security, and performance testing
- **Priority**: Low
- **Dependencies**: Phase 5 & 6 completion

## 📚 Key Lessons Learned

### **Testing Strategy** 🧪
1. **Mock Object Consistency**: Always use proper type implementations
2. **Interface Alignment**: Keep tests synchronized with service changes
3. **Incremental Approach**: Fix one test suite at a time for better progress tracking
4. **Compilation First**: Address compilation errors before logic issues

### **Architecture Decisions** 🏗️
1. **Result Pattern**: The `Result<T, E>` pattern improves error handling consistency
2. **Configuration Centralization**: Single source of truth reduces configuration drift
3. **Service Evolution**: Tests must evolve with service implementations
4. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript integration prevents runtime errors

### **Development Process** 🔄
1. **Documentation First**: Better documentation reduces development friction
2. **Testing Early**: Establish testing patterns from the beginning
3. **Incremental Refactoring**: Small, focused changes are easier to test and validate
4. **Regular Status Updates**: Track progress and identify blockers early
