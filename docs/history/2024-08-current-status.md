## 🎮 **Fibbing It Engine Features**

### **Core Gameplay**
- **Trivia deception game** - Players answer factual questions or create believable bluffs
- **Multi-round structure** with configurable max rounds (default: 5)
- **Dynamic prompt selection** from seed data with no-repeat logic
- **Real-time scoring** with points for deception and detection

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Type-safe interfaces** with proper TypeScript types
- **Immutable state management** following functional programming principles
- **Event-driven architecture** with comprehensive event generation
- **Validation system** preventing invalid actions and state corruption

### **Game Flow**
1. **Lobby** → Players join and wait for host to start
2. **Prompt** → Players submit answers (60s timer)
3. **Voting** → Players vote on answers (45s timer)
4. **Reveal** → Show correct answers and vote results
5. **Scoring** → Calculate and award points
6. **Round End** → Prepare for next round or end game

## 🎯 **Key Decisions Made**

### **Architecture Choices**
- **"From scratch" approach** for game engines instead of incremental refactoring
- **Simplified interfaces** prioritizing ease of implementation over flexibility
- **Event-driven design** for real-time game updates
- **Immutable state patterns** for predictable game behavior

### **Technical Trade-offs**
- **Type safety over flexibility** - Strict interfaces prevent runtime errors
- **Performance over complexity** - Simple, fast implementations
- **Maintainability over features** - Clean, readable code first
- **Testing over speed** - Comprehensive coverage before optimization

---

## 🔍 **Lessons Learned**

### **What Worked Well**
1. **Incremental testing** - Fixing one test suite at a time
2. **Integration testing** - Real service interactions revealed real issues
3. **Mock isolation** - Proper test setup prevented interference
4. **Type safety** - TypeScript caught many issues before runtime

### **Challenges Overcome**
1. **Test isolation** - Complex service dependencies required careful mocking
2. **Interface alignment** - Ensuring mocks match actual service signatures
3. **State management** - Immutable patterns required careful state updates
4. **Error handling** - Comprehensive error scenarios needed thorough testing
