## 🎯 **What We Accomplished**

### **📊 Final Results**
- **Test Suites**: 15/15 passing (100%) 🎯
- **Tests**: 222/222 passing (100%) 🎯
- **Total Time**: 10.161 seconds
- **Status**: **PERFECT SCORE** 🏅

### **🔍 The Journey**
We started with mysterious test failures that seemed unrelated, but through systematic debugging, we discovered the **timer cleanup warnings were indeed connected** to the test failures! They were masking a **mock completeness issue**.

### **⚡ Issues Solved**
1. **✅ Mock Socket Completeness**: Added missing `to()` method
2. **✅ Test Isolation**: Fixed Jest worker process warnings
3. **✅ Error Handling**: Proper validation error emission
4. **✅ Mock Coverage**: Complete service mocking
5. **✅ Test Cleanup**: Proper timer and mock cleanup
