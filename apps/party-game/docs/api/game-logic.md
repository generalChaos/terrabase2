## Data Structures

### Player

```typescript
interface Player {
  id: string; // Unique player identifier
  name: string; // Display name (2-20 characters)
  avatar: string; // Emoji avatar
  score: number; // Current score
  connected: boolean; // Connection status
}
```

### Round State

```typescript
interface RoundState {
  roundNumber: number; // Current round (1-5)
  promptId: string; // Question/prompt identifier
  prompt: string; // Game content
  submissions: Submission[]; // Player submissions
  votes: Map<string, string>; // Player votes
  timeLeft: number; // Seconds remaining
  phase: string; // Current phase
}
```

### Submission

```typescript
interface Submission {
  id: string; // Unique submission identifier
  text: string; // Submission content
  playerId: string; // Player who submitted
  type: 'answer' | 'story' | 'association'; // Game-specific type
}
```

## Configuration

### Centralized Game Settings

All game settings are centralized in the `GameConfig` object:

```typescript
const GameConfig = {
  TIMING: {
    PHASES: {
      PROMPT: 15, // Base prompt time (varies by game)
      CHOOSE: 20, // Base choose time (varies by game)
      SCORING: 6, // Base scoring time (varies by game)
    },
  },
  RULES: {
    ROUNDS: {
      MAX_ROUNDS: 5, // Maximum rounds per game
      MIN_PLAYERS_TO_START: 2, // Minimum players required
    },
    SCORING: {
      CORRECT_ANSWER: 1000, // Points for correct answer
      BLUFF_POINTS: 500, // Points per player fooled
    },
    PLAYERS: {
      MAX_PLAYERS_PER_ROOM: 8, // Maximum players in room
      MIN_NICKNAME_LENGTH: 2, // Minimum nickname length
      MAX_NICKNAME_LENGTH: 20, // Maximum nickname length
    },
  },
  GAME_TYPES: {
    BLUFF_TRIVIA: 'bluff-trivia',
    FIBBING_IT: 'fibbing-it',
    WORD_ASSOCIATION: 'word-association',
  },
};
```

### Game-Specific Timing

Each game engine can override default timing:

```typescript
getPhaseDuration(phase: string): number {
  const durations: Record<string, number> = {
    lobby: 0,
    prompt: 60,    // 60 seconds for Fibbing It
    voting: 30,    // 30 seconds for Fibbing It
    scoring: 15,   // 15 seconds for Fibbing It
    over: 0,
  };
  return durations[phase] || 0;
}
```

### Timer Behavior

- **Automatic progression** when timer expires
- **Manual progression** when all players complete actions
- **Grace period** for late submissions (within reason)

## Error Handling

### Common Game Errors

- **Invalid Phase**: Action not allowed in current phase
- **Already Submitted**: Player already submitted answer/vote
- **Time Expired**: Action submitted after phase ended
- **Invalid Choice**: Vote for non-existent choice
- **Insufficient Players**: Not enough players to start game
- **Player Not Host**: Non-host trying to perform host action

### Error Recovery

- **Graceful degradation** when possible
- **State consistency** maintained
- **Player feedback** for all errors
- **Automatic cleanup** of invalid states

## Game Engine Architecture

### Pluggable Design

Games use a common interface for consistency:

```typescript
interface GameEngine<
  TState extends BaseGameState,
  TAction extends GameAction,
  TEvent extends GameEvent,
> {
  initialize(players: Player[]): TState;
  processAction(state: TState, action: TAction): GameResult<TState, TEvent>;
  getValidActions(state: TState, playerId: string): TAction[];
  isGameOver(state: TState): boolean;
  getWinners(state: TState): Player[];
  getCurrentPhase(state: TState): GamePhase;
  advancePhase(state: TState): TState;
  getTimeLeft(state: TState): number;
  updateTimer(state: TState, delta: number): TState;
  generatePhaseEvents(state: TState): TEvent[];
}
```

### State Management

- **Immutable state** with Result pattern
- **Type-safe operations** across all game types
- **Consistent error handling** using standardized error types
- **Automatic cleanup** and resource management
