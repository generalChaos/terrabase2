## 🛠️ **Enhanced Prompt Structure**

### **Base Logo Generation Prompt**
```typescript
const generateLogoPrompt = (teamData: TeamData): string => {
  return `
You are a professional team logo designer. Create a team logo based on the following specifications:

Team Name: ${teamData.name}
Sport: ${teamData.sport}
Logo Style: ${teamData.style}
Color Palette: ${teamData.colors}
Mascot Concept: ${teamData.mascot}

CRITICAL STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Professional vector-style illustration (NOT painterly, sketchy, or hand-drawn)
- Clean, sharp edges with consistent line weights
- Flat design with minimal cell shading only
- Solid color blocks with no gradients
- High contrast colors with clean separation
- No artifacts, noise, or inconsistent details
- Print-ready quality with crisp edges
- Professional sports logo aesthetic
- Clean, modern design principles
- Consistent style throughout the entire logo
- Sharp, precise details
- High resolution, clean output

QUALITY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate a professional sports logo that looks like it was created by a professional graphic designer
- Use clean, vector-style illustration techniques
- Ensure all lines are sharp and consistent
- Use solid colors with no gradients or complex shading
- Maintain high contrast between elements
- Create a design that would work well on uniforms and merchandise
- Avoid any painterly, sketchy, or hand-drawn elements
- Ensure the logo is scalable and print-ready
- Use professional typography if text is included
- Create a design that is both memorable and professional

Create a professional team logo that:
- Incorporates the team name prominently
- Uses the selected color palette
- Features the chosen mascot concept
- Matches the specified logo style
- Is suitable for use on t-shirts, banners, and other team materials
- Works well at both large and small sizes
- Has a clean, professional appearance

Generate 3 different variations of this logo, each with a slightly different approach:
1. Text-focused version (emphasizes team name)
2. Mascot-focused version (emphasizes the mascot)
3. Balanced version (equal emphasis on text and mascot)

   - Update quality thresholds
   - Optimize for consistency

## 📊 **Quality Metrics Implementation**

### **Visual Quality Scoring**
```typescript
interface QualityScore {
  cleanEdges: number;        // 0-25 points
  professionalStyle: number; // 0-25 points
  colorQuality: number;      // 0-25 points
  composition: number;       // 0-25 points
  total: number;            // 0-100 points
}

const calculateQualityScore = (logoUrl: string): QualityScore => {
  // Implementation for quality scoring
  // Based on King Cobra analysis criteria
};
```

### **Quality Thresholds**
```typescript
const QUALITY_THRESHOLDS = {
  MINIMUM_OVERALL: 85,
  MINIMUM_STYLE_CONSISTENCY: 95,
  MINIMUM_EDGE_QUALITY: 90
};
```

## 🎯 **Success Factors Implementation**

### **Professional Illustration Standards**
